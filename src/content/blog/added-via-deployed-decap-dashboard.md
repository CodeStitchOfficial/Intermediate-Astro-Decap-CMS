Netlify Identity has been removed, and the kit now uses decapbridge.com. Why?\
\
## Netlify Identity has been deprecated\
\
## decapbridge is super easy to use

Setting up a token on Github might be a bit scary, and is arguably a bit more complex that toggling Identity on Netlify, but it makes up for it by:



* platform agnostic: you can now host your site anywhere!
* better user management experience compared to Identity
