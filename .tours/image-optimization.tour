This optimized image is passed to BaseLayout's **preloadedImage** prop to preload it and use it for Open Graph tags.",

			"description": "Here we use Astro's built-in **<Picture />** component for responsive images. It imports the image from @assets/, then renders it with multiple formats (**avif**, **webp**). The **priority** attribute tells the browser to load this image immediately (important for above-the-fold images). The **pictureAttributes** prop adds CSS classes.",

			"description": "This is a custom component for **art-directed responsive images** - when you want different images for mobile vs desktop. It uses **getImage()** to optimize both sources separately, then outputs a <picture> element with <source> tags for different screen sizes. Use this when you need more control than the standard Picture component provides.",
